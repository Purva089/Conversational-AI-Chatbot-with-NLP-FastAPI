# Conversational AI Chatbot with NLP & FastAPI

A scalable, production-ready conversational AI chatbot backend built with **FastAPI** and modern NLP techniques. This project demonstrates how to create, serve, and test a chatbot API using Python and cutting-edge libraries for natural language understanding.

## 🚀 Features

- **FastAPI** server for high-performance async chat API
- Built-in intent recognition and response generation using NLP
- Modular code: easily plug in different NLP models or intents
- Simple REST endpoints for chat messages and health check
- Easy local deployment and Docker support
- Fully documented for developers

## 🧠 How It Works

- User sends a message to `/chat` endpoint.
- The backend processes and detects intent using NLP (such as NLTK, spaCy, or Transformers).
- Generates a relevant response and sends it back.
- Easily extend or swap out the NLP engine in `nlp_engine.py` for more advanced ML/NLP models.
